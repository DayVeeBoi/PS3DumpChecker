A PS3DumpChecker fork
==============

This is a fork of Swizzy's PS3DumpChecker program to allow the checking of the partial NAND/eMMC dumps that PS3Xploit creates. 
Huge thanks to Littlebalup's PyPS3Checker for the offsets making this project possible.


Status:
PS3Xploit 239MB NAND: ✔️
PS3Xploit 239MB eMMC: ❓ (I ported the offsets the same way I ported the NAND offsets, so this should hopefully work).


NOTE: Nobody takes ANY responsibility for any false negative/false positive given by this app, the responsibilty that your dump is valid is YOURS and yours alone.
